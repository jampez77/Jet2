## Installation through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)

There is an active [PR](https://github.com/hacs/default/pull/2647) to get this into [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/), once that is merged then you can install the **Jet2** integration by searching for it there in HA instance.

Until then you will have to add this repository manually:

Go to HACS -> 3 dot menu -> Custom Repositories:- 

Paste `https://github.com/jampez77/Jet2` into Repository field and select `Integration`

Now you should be able to find it in HACS as normal.

You can install the **Jet2** integration by searching for it there in HA instance.

## Manual Installation
Use this route only if you do not want to use [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) and love the pain of manually installing regular updates.
* Add the `jet2` folder in your `custom_components` folder

## Usage

Each entry requires a `booking reference`, `date of birth` and `surname`. These will be the same you use to view your booking on the Jet2 website.

## Data 
The integration will either create a new calendar or add events to an existing calendar for every instance that will have any flights and check-in open time, as well as payment due date and the booking expiration date. the booking expiration date is used as a marker for removing entities from HA. once the expiration date is within an hour of the current (HA's) time it will remove all entities for that booking. 
There is also a camera that will stream accommodation images when they are available. Additionally the following information is also made available to HA:
